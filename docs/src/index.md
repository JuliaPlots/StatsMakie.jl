# Introduction

## Overview

StatsMakie attempts to combine idea from what is generally called "Grammar of Graphics", i.e. the ability to cleanly express in a plot how to translate variable from a dataset into graphical attributes, with the high performance interactive plotting package Makie.

On top of that, StatsMakie provides a set of recipes for interactive statistical analysis (histograms, linear and non-linear regression, density plots...).

## Getting started

To install StatsMakie, simply type:

```
(v1.0) pkg> add AbstractPlotting#master Makie#master https://github.com/JuliaPlots/StatsMakie.jl.git
```

in the Pkg console.
